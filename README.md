# Rusalka Virtual Machine

The Rusalka VM is a small personal project of mine to implement a fairly simple
register-based virtual machine -- not one that intends to mimic hardware, but
one that simply provides instructions that are hopefully useful.

Perhaps the VM will one day be aptly named. Right now, it's a pretty big hack
and in need of profiling (and a well-defined calling convention). Toy with it
as you like.
