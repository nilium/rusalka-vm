# Rusalka Virtual Machine

The Rusalka VM is a small personal project of mine to implement a fairly simple
register-based virtual machine -- not one that intends to mimic hardware, but
one that simply provides instructions that are hopefully useful.

Perhaps the VM will one day be aptly named. Right now, it's a pretty big hack
and in need of profiling (and a well-defined calling convention). Toy with it
as you like.


# Contributing

If you want to contribute to Rusalka VM's development, it's simplest to create
a patch and submit it via a pull request on [Rusalka's GitHub repository].
Please include a decent explanation of your changes to help folks read them
(i.e., walk me through why you made the change, what it does, etc.).
